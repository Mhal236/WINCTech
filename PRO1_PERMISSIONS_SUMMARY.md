## Permission Logic Implementation

### In AuthContext (`hasPermission` function):
```typescript
// Pro-1 technicians can access pro-1, admin (jobs/calendar/history), and user content
if (userRole === 'pro-1' && (requiredRole === 'pro-1' || requiredRole === 'admin' || requiredRole === 'user')) return true;

// For admin-level access, allow admin, pro-2, and pro-1 users
if (requiredRole === 'admin') {
  return ['admin', 'pro-2', 'pro-1'].includes(userRole);
}
```

### Navigation Requirements:
- **Home**: `requiredRole: "user"` ✅ (Pro-1 has user access)
- **Jobs**: `requiredRole: "admin"` ✅ (Pro-1 has admin access for core technician features)
- **Calendar**: `requiredRole: "admin"` ✅ (Pro-1 has admin access for core technician features)
- **History**: `requiredRole: "admin"` ✅ (Pro-1 has admin access for core technician features)
- **Settings**: `requiredRole: "user"` ✅ (Pro-1 has user access)

### Restricted Navigation (Pro-2+ Only):
- **ARGIC Search**: `requiredRole: "pro-2"` ❌ (Pro-1 cannot access)
- **Glass Order**: `requiredRole: "pro-2"` ❌ (Pro-1 cannot access)

## User Journey

### New Technician Workflow:
1. **Sign Up** → Status: `pending` (limited access)
2. **Application Approved** → Status: `pro-1` (full technician access)
3. **Experience/Promotion** → Status: `pro-2` (administrative access)
4. **System Admin** → Status: `admin` (complete access)

## Testing Verification

Current test user `tech@windscreencompare.com`:
- User Role: `pro-1`
- Verification Status: `verified`  
- Technician Status: `pro-1`
- Expected Access: ✅ Home, Jobs, Calendar, History, Contact, Settings

This gives Pro-1 technicians everything they need to perform their core job functions while restricting access to administrative features that should be reserved for more senior roles.
