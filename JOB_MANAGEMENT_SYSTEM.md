- **Green checkmark** for completed
- **Yellow warning** for incomplete
- **Optional notes textarea** for additional information
- **Single submit button** to finalize

### ðŸ“Š Essential Job Information

**Single Card Layout** with 4 sections in a 2x2 grid:

#### Customer Section

- Phone (clickable to call)
- Email (clickable to email)
- Location with map pin icon

#### Vehicle Section
- UK-style registration plate (yellow background)
- Make, model, and year
- Glass type required

#### Appointment Section
- Date in readable format
- Time slot with clock icon

#### Price Section
- Large quote price display in teal
- Simple, prominent pricing

### ðŸ“¦ Linked Glass Order (Inline)

- Compact, non-intrusive design

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes

**Migration File**: `supabase/migrations/20251018150000_add_job_progress_field.sql`

```sql
ALTER TABLE public."MasterCustomer" 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS job_progress TEXT DEFAULT 'assigned';

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_master_customer_job_progress 
ON public."MasterCustomer"(job_progress);
```

**Job Progress Values**:
- `assigned` - Initial state
- `glass_ordered` - Glass has been ordered
- `glass_received` - Glass delivered/ready
- `in_progress` - Work started
- `completed` - Job finished

### New Component

**File**: `src/pages/JobManagement.tsx`

**Key Features**:
- Full-screen dashboard layout
- Responsive grid system (3-column on desktop)
- Real-time data fetching from Supabase
- Automatic stage calculation based on job progress
- Integration with existing job assignment system

**State Management**:
```typescript
- job: Job | null          // Current job details
- glassOrder: GlassOrder  // Linked glass order (if any)
- stages: JobStage[]      // Array of progress stages
- loading: boolean        // Data loading state
- updating: boolean       // Progress update state
```

**Key Functions**:
- `fetchJobDetails()` - Loads job data from server
- `fetchLinkedGlassOrder()` - Gets associated glass order
- `updateStagesFromJob()` - Calculates stage statuses
- `progressToNextStage()` - Advances job to next stage
- `updateJobProgress()` - Updates database with new progress

### Routing

**Added Route**: `/jobs/:jobId`
- Protected route requiring "pro-1" role
- Lazy loaded for performance
- Fully integrated with app navigation

**Navigation Flow**:
1. Jobs Page â†’ Click on any active job card
2. Navigates to `/jobs/{jobId}`
3. Loads full job management interface
4. Can return to Jobs page via "Back" button
5. Clicking "Complete Job" or "Calendar" buttons within card doesn't navigate away

### Jobs Page Integration

**Updated**: `src/pages/Jobs.tsx`

**Changes to Active Jobs Tab**:
- Made entire job card clickable to open job management
- Added hover effects: cursor pointer, teal border highlight
- Removed separate "Manage Job" button for cleaner UI
- Buttons within card use `stopPropagation()` to prevent card click
- "Complete Job" and "Calendar" buttons still work independently

```typescript
<Card 
  key={job.id} 
  className="hover:shadow-lg transition-all border-l-4 border-l-yellow-500 cursor-pointer hover:border-l-[#0FB8C1]"
  onClick={() => navigate(`/jobs/${job.id}`)}
>
  {/* Card content */}
  <Button onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>
    Complete Job
  </Button>
</Card>
```

## User Experience
