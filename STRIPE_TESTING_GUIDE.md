# Stripe Payment Testing Guide

## 🚀 Quick Setup

You mentioned you have the Stripe publishable key in your `.env` file as `next_public_stripe_publishable_key`. You need to add one more environment variable:

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# In your .env file:
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_51...  # You already have this
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_51...         # Add this (same value as above)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_51...                   # Add this (your Stripe SECRET key)
```

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### ✅ Multiple GoTrueClient Instances
- **Fixed**: Added singleton pattern to prevent multiple Supabase client instances
- **Result**: Cleaner console logs, no more warnings about concurrent storage usage

### ✅ Content Security Policy (CSP) Warnings  
- **Fixed**: Added CSP meta tags to allow Stripe domains and Google Fonts
- **Result**: No more CSP violations when Stripe loads its payment elements

### ✅ Build Success
- **Status**: Application builds successfully with all Stripe dependencies
- **Components**: PaymentModal, StripeService, and API endpoints all integrated

## 🧪 Testing the Payment Flow

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Navigate to Top Up Page
- Go to: `http://localhost:8081/topup`
- You should see the updated TopUp page with brand colors

### 3. Test Payment Packages

**Stripe Test Cards:**
- **Success**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Declined**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- **Insufficient Funds**: `4000 0000 0000 9995`
- **Expiry**: Any future date (e.g., `12/25`)
- **CVC**: Any 3 digits (e.g., `123`)

### 4. Test Flow:
1. **Select a package** (Starter, Professional, or Enterprise)
2. **Click "Select Package"** - should open payment modal
3. **Enter test card details**
4. **Click "Pay £X.XX"**
5. **Check for success message**
6. **Verify credits are added** to user balance

### 5. Check Console Logs
You should see:
- ✅ No multiple GoTrueClient warnings
- ✅ No CSP violations from Stripe
- ✅ Successful payment processing logs
- ✅ Credit balance updates

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Payment Modal Doesn't Open:
- Check browser console for Stripe key errors
- Verify environment variables are loaded
- Check network tab for failed API calls

### If Payment Fails:
- Verify `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is set in server environment
- Check API server logs for errors
- Ensure database `credit_transactions` table exists

### If Credits Don't Update:
- Check browser network tab for API call responses
- Look for database errors in server logs
- Verify user authentication is working

## 📊 What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. **Payment Intent Creation** → Server creates secure payment intent with Stripe
2. **Payment Processing** → Stripe Elements handles secure card processing  
3. **Payment Confirmation** → Server verifies payment with Stripe API
4. **Credit Allocation** → Server updates user credits in database
5. **Transaction Logging** → Creates audit trail in `credit_transactions` table
6. **UI Update** → Frontend refreshes to show new credit balance

## 🎯 Expected Results

After successful payment:
- ✅ Payment modal shows success message
- ✅ User credit balance updates immediately  
- ✅ Transaction recorded in database
- ✅ Toast notification confirms success
- ✅ Modal closes automatically

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **Test Mode**: All payments use Stripe test mode (safe to test)
- **Real Money**: No real money will be charged during testing
- **Database**: Test transactions are saved to your database
- **Security**: All payment processing happens server-side for security

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the console logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure your Stripe keys are for the same Stripe account
4. Check that the API server is running on port 3000

The Stripe integration is now complete and ready for testing! 🎉
