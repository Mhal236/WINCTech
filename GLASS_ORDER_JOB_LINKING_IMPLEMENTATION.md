# Glass Order Job Linking - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This feature allows technicians to link glass orders to their active jobs, creating a connection between orders and customer jobs for better tracking and organization.

## Database Changes

### Migration File: `supabase/migrations/20251018140000_add_job_linking_to_glass_orders.sql`

**Changes Made:**
- Added `job_id` column (UUID) to `glass_orders` table
  - References `MasterCustomer.id`
  - Nullable, CASCADE on delete
- Added `customer_name` column (TEXT) to cache customer name for display
- Created index `idx_glass_orders_job_id` for faster lookups
- Added documentation comments

**Applied:** ✅ Migration successfully applied to Supabase

## New Component

### `src/components/orders/LinkOrderToJob.tsx`

A dialog-based component matching the provided design specifications:

**Features:**
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time filtering of active jobs by customer name, VRN, or vehicle info
- **Active Jobs Dropdown**: Shows ONLY active jobs (in_progress status)
  - Excludes leads (status: 'assigned')
  - Excludes completed jobs (status: 'completed')
  - Excludes cancelled jobs (status: 'cancelled')
  - White background (not transparent)
- **Job Preview Card**: Displays selected job with teal background and user icon
- **Action Buttons**:
  - "Continue without linking" (gray, dismisses dialog)
  - "Link & Continue" (teal, saves link and refreshes data)
- **Create New Job Link**: Navigates to instant-leads page

**Styling:**
- Teal (#0FB8C1) border on search input
- Teal primary button
- Light teal (bg-teal-50) preview card
- White background on dropdown (bg-white for SelectTrigger and SelectContent)
- Responsive design

## Updated Components

### 1. `src/pages/OrderConfirmation.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added imports: `Badge`, `Link2`, `UserCheck`, `LinkOrderToJob`
- Updated `GlassOrder` interface to include `job_id` and `customer_name`
- Added state: `showLinkDialog`
- Made `fetchOrder` function callable for refreshing after linking
- Added new UI section between payment status and "What happens next?"

**UI Behavior:**
- **If Linked**: Shows teal card with checkmark, customer name, and "Change Job" button
- **If Not Linked**: Shows blue card with link icon, description, and "Assign to Job" button
- Dialog opens when buttons are clicked
- Automatically refreshes order data after successful linking

### 2. `src/pages/History.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added imports: `Link2`, `UserCheck`, `LinkOrderToJob`
- Added states: `showLinkDialog`, `selectedOrderId`, `selectedOrderJobId`
- Added handler functions:
  - `handleLinkOrderToJob()`: Opens dialog with selected order
  - `refreshGlassOrders()`: Refreshes glass orders list after linking
- Updated Glass Orders tab UI

**Glass Orders Tab Updates:**
- **Status Badges**: Added link status badge next to order status
  - Linked: Teal badge with "Linked: Customer Name"
  - Not Linked: Gray outline badge with "Not Linked"
- **Action Buttons**: Added two buttons below each order
  - "Assign to Job" / "Change Job" (teal, opens link dialog)
  - "View Details" (gray, navigates to order confirmation)
- Dialog integration at component bottom

## User Flow

### From Order Confirmation Page:
1. Complete payment → redirected to order confirmation
2. See "Link to Active Job" section with blue card
3. Click "Assign to Job" button
4. Dialog opens with search and dropdown
5. Search/select active job
6. Preview appears in teal card
7. Click "Link & Continue"
8. Success toast appears
9. Section updates to show linked status with customer name
10. Can click "Change Job" to reassign

### From History Page (Glass Orders Tab):
1. Navigate to History → Glass Orders tab
2. See all glass orders with link status badges
3. Orders show "Not Linked" or "Linked: Customer Name"
4. Click "Assign to Job" button (or "Change Job" if already linked)
5. Same dialog flow as above
6. After linking, list refreshes with updated badge
7. Can reassign at any time

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.glass_orders 
ADD COLUMN job_id UUID REFERENCES public."MasterCustomer"(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
ADD COLUMN customer_name TEXT;

CREATE INDEX idx_glass_orders_job_id ON public.glass_orders(job_id);
```

### Active Jobs Query
- Fetches jobs via `/api/technician/jobs` endpoint
- **Strict filtering** to show ONLY active jobs (matching Jobs page logic):
  - Status must be `in_progress` (this is what defines "active" vs "lead")
  - Leads have status `assigned` and are excluded
  - Must have valid `MasterCustomer` data
  - Excludes `completed` and `cancelled` statuses
- Maps to format: `{ id, customer_name, vehicle_reg, vehicle_info, etc. }`

**Job Status Definitions (from Jobs page):**
- `assigned` = Lead (not yet active)
- `in_progress` = Active Job
- `completed` = Completed Job
- `cancelled` = Cancelled Job

### Link Update Query
```typescript
await supabase
  .from("glass_orders")
  .update({
    job_id: selectedJobId,
    customer_name: selectedJob.customer_name,
  })
  .eq("id", orderId);
```

## Styling Consistency

All components follow the established design system:
- **Primary Color**: #0FB8C1 (teal/cyan)
- **Borders**: 2px on important cards
- **Shadows**: shadow-lg for elevated elements
- **Hover States**: Darker teal (#0d9da5)
- **Icons**: Lucide React (Link2, UserCheck, User)
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first grid layouts
